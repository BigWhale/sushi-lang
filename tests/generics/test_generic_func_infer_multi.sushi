# Test: Generic function with multiple type parameters
# Phase 2: Verifies generic function definition parsing with two type params
#
# This test defines a generic swap function that takes two values
# of different types (T and U). The function definition is collected
# in Pass 0 and added to the GenericFunctionTable.
#
# Note: Actual calls to generic functions will work in Phase 3
# when monomorphization is implemented.

fn swap<T, U>(T a, U b) ~:
    return Result.Ok(~)

fn main() i32:
    # Phase 2: Generic function defined but not yet callable
    # Phase 3 will add monomorphization to generate concrete versions
    return Result.Ok(0)
