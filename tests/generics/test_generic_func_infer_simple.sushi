# Test: Generic function with single type parameter
# Phase 2: Verifies generic function definition parsing
#
# This test defines a generic identity function that takes a value
# of type T and returns it. The function definition is collected in
# Pass 0 and added to the GenericFunctionTable.
#
# Note: Actual calls to generic functions will work in Phase 3
# when monomorphization is implemented.

fn identity<T>(T x) T:
    return Result.Ok(x)

fn main() i32:
    # Phase 2: Generic function defined but not yet callable
    # Phase 3 will add monomorphization to generate concrete versions
    return Result.Ok(0)
