# Test: Generic function with struct type parameter
# Phase 2: Verifies generic function definition parsing with struct types
#
# This test defines a generic identity function that can accept
# user-defined struct types. The function should work with Point
# once Phase 3 monomorphization is implemented.
#
# Note: Actual calls to generic functions will work in Phase 3
# when monomorphization is implemented.

struct Point:
    i32 x
    i32 y

fn identity<T>(T value) T:
    return Result.Ok(value)

fn main() i32:
    # Phase 2: Generic function defined but not yet callable
    # Phase 3 will add monomorphization to generate concrete versions
    return Result.Ok(0)
