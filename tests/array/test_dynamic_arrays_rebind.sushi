# Test: Dynamic array rebinding with move semantics
# This test verifies that rebinding transfers ownership correctly
# Move semantics prevent double-free by nullifying the source array

fn main() i32:
  # Move semantics ensure ownership transfer
  let i32[] arr1 = from([1, 2, 3])
  let i32[] arr2 = from([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])

  # This transfers ownership: arr2 is nullified and arr1 now owns the memory
  arr1 := arr2

  # At scope exit, only arr1 is freed (arr2 was moved and marked as invalid)
  return Result.Ok(0)
